## ðŸ™‹ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is my data backed up to the cloud?**  
A: No. FreqLinks Premium stores all your bookmarks locally in your browser. This ensures complete privacy but means you should use browser settings to preserve data between cleanups.

**Q: Will I lose my bookmarks if I clear browser data?**  
A: Yes, if you clear local storage or site data. Consider using your browser's settings to exclude FreqLinks Premium data during cleanups.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many bookmarks I can save?**  
A: The limit is determined by your browser's local storage capacity, typically allowing hundreds of bookmarks including those with custom icons.

**Q: Does FreqLinks work offline?**  
A: Yes! After initial loading, FreqLinks Premium functions completely offline, making it perfect for travel or unreliable internet.

**Q: Is FreqLinks free to use?**  
A: FreqLinks Premium is available for a one-time download with no subscription fees or in-app purchases.

## ðŸš¦ Troubleshooting Tips

**Bookmarks disappeared?**  
This typically happens after clearing browser data. FreqLinks Premium stores data locally, so clearing site data will remove bookmarks.

**Can't upload images?**  
Ensure your image is under 1MB in size. Larger files might not be properly stored in local storage.

**Dark mode not saving?**  
Check that your browser allows local storage for the site where FreqLinks Premium is running.
